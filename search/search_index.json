This system provides a structured approach to map GIS metadata fields to energy modeling components, thereby streamlining the energy modeling process for state-, national-, and global-scale analyses. Unlike traditional UBEM template archetype approaches, the key innovation lies in avoiding the need for energy modelers to manually create full-factorial combinations of building templates. Instead, it enables them to develop a library of individual components and define mapping rules that automatically select appropriate components based on building-specific metadata. This allows for maintaining a separation of concerns between the semantic information lives in the GIS data (e.g. \"woodframe construction\" or \"high-income household\"), and the interpretation of that data as it is compiled into an energy model. It also enables flexibility by providing mechanisms for dealing with incomplete or incrementally updated data as well as probabilistic modeling. It also provides an easy mechanism for running different types of analysis on the same underlying GIS data, for instance running the data through a black-box simulation engine for rapid monthly energy-estimates and then separately through a white-box simulation engine with an entirely different set of modeling inputs for a detailed overheating analysis.</p>"},{"location":"#system-overview","title":"System overview","text":"<p>The system operates by interpreting a manifest (specification file) that outlines how GIS metadata fields correspond to energy modeling components. The manifest is divided into three primary sections:</p> <ol> <li>requires: Specifies the required metadata fields, their data types, allowable ranges or enumerations, and default values. Can be used to validate compatibility with incoming GIS data.</li> <li>computes: Defines computed fields derived from existing metadata, allowing for grouping or breakpointing of data to create new variables which can be referenced in the component map.</li> <li>component-map: Establishes the mapping rules that determine which energy modeling components (or values) are selected based on the provided and computed fields.</li> </ol> <p>Energy modeling engines can use a manifest to systematically interpret semantic GIS metadata and compile specific energy models, ensuring flexibility, consistency and scalability in large-scale bottom-up energy modeling.</p>"},{"location":"#manifest-schema","title":"Manifest schema","text":""},{"location":"#example-manifest","title":"Example manifest","text":"<p>An example manifest which defines each of the sections mentioned above is provided below.
